## "Designign the Human Computer Interface"

https://www.jstor.org/stable/44425106?seq=1#references_tab_contents

### Harold J Godes in _Educational Technology_, 1983

An interesting paper to read now due to it's time: he speaks of the anxieties of _modernity_ as exemplified in Chaplin's _Modern Times_. Also of the transition between computers as the domain of programmers to the domain of everyone else.

> The unvarnished complexity acceptable to the knowledgeable user is intolerable to the casual or timid user. The design of the flexible, supportive human-computer interface is the unavoidable consequence of the widespread and spreading use of computers.

Offers omprehensive on principles for good interface design: **support, orientation and personalization**. They are interesting becasue of how relevant they are, four decades later!

> Assume present trends continue. Memory cheapens. Processing speed increases. Storage capacity grows. What techniques for support, orientation and personalization can we imagine?

A visionary description of machines responding in voices, "head-up displays", holographic information, all resembling our current stage of converstaional interfaces and AR.

> In the computer, man has a tool that allows individuals to search, wonder, and play in ways beyond the reach of mere wealth. The computer to some is a kind of magic or perhaps sorcery. Some who never care to know how it is done can believe what they wish and enjoy it nonetheless. Others who want to know can learn the trick, and in doing som find the science that underlies the magic.
